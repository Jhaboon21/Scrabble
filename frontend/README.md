Things I need to do:
create a gameboard - rows/columns
create a 'letter bag' - should hold ~100 tiles? likely predetermined so the game can end when players run out of letters. should hold certain number of each letter.
should also 'shuffle' or give random letters out to the players
determine whose turn it is
on turn load, distribute letters to players(7).
on turn, players must put down 2 or more to form a valid word.
player must submit their letters on the board to be checked
if word is 1 letter, or invalid, flash warning and return letter to hand.
on next turn, keep the unplayed letters and refill to max(7).
keep track of each player's score using the api.
if not the current player's turn, do not allow them to place letters on board.
players should only view their own hand.
on game end, determine who has the most points and delcare them the winner.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
